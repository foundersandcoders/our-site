# Web application development

## Web and mobile

We specialise in developing software applications for both Web and mobile using *JavaScript*, *Node.js* and *React*. You can find some examples of our recent work [here](www.foundersandcoders.org/case-studies).

We have particular expertise in:
  
+ Prototyping
+ UX design (**U**ser e**x**perience)
+ Content management
+ Membership and user management
+ Business productivity
+ Data visualisation and mapping

## Our approach  

We begin every project by working with our clients to agree on the look and feel of the application/website, and develop *user journeys* that plot how users will interact with it. Short-term goals are set and reviewed generally every two weeks, but we aim for *continuous delivery* - and clients are kept fully informed of progress by their dedicated client liaison.  

The *product owner* on the client side will also be able to track progress and give feedback using the product management tool PivotalTracker. We understand that many tools and concepts will be unfamiliar, and so are happy to provide support and training in product management to all clients. This aspect of the process is of general value to any client interested in commissioning web/mobile applications, not just as part of a single project.

All of our code is well-documented and accompanied by concise README documents to ensure that it can be maintained in the future - whether by our team or someone else.

You can read about our approach in greater detail below.

## Agile project mangement

All our projects begin with a period of requirements gathering in which client needs are translated into a series of *user journeys*, *wireframes*, and testable *user stories* that define an application. Development usually proceeds in a series of two-week *sprints*, each involving a planning and review process in which short-term *sprint goals* are set and reviewed. We aim for *continuous delivery* to the client of testable features (*“user stories”*).   

Project teams usually include: a *scrum master*, who ensures that nothing is impeding the work of the development team; a *client liaison*, who ensures that the client is kept fully informed of progress on the project; a *lead developer*, who ensures code quality; and a *product owner*, who takes responsibility for approving user stories as they are delivered. The product owner is usually supplied by the client (for whom we can supply training, if required).

Change requests are added to the *project backlog* by the product owner and incorporated as a matter of course through the use of a repository of new user stories (the *“icebox”*) and a process of re-prioritisation of user stories at the beginning of every sprint. Minor changes are expected and can usually be accommodated within previously-agreed time and budget.

## Test-driven development

We practise *test-driven development* (TDD) and *behaviour-driven development* (BDD), where product features, expressed as user stories, are turned into *acceptance tests*, i.e. automated software tests that demonstrate whether or not the application software actually behaves as expected, and these are written before any code is actually created. We use automated tools to maintain measures of code coverage (i.e. what proportion of the code is covered by an associated test) and to identify failing tests.  

We practise *paired programming* to ensure that all developers involved in a project share a common approach to the codebase and create readable code.  We undertake *code reviews* where developers not involved in a project review the quality of the code being created by the development team.

We deliver well-documented code, based around concise README documents, so that in years to come our code will be maintainable, either by us or by others, and that anyone returning to the codebase or looking at it with fresh eyes will be able to understand our original intent. 

## Training

We offer training and support in *product management* to our clients. We particularly recommend our low-cost prototyping service, which provides the opportunity to combine valuable hands-on training with real-world application specification and product development.
