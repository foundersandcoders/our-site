# Applications

We are now accepting applications for the course that is starting in October, based at our Bethnal Green campus.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](apply1.html) (the shorter one)
+ [Application form, Part 2](apply2.html) (the longer one)

We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).

We offer places on a rolling basis, but we strongly recommend that you apply early, regardless of whether you have met the minimum application criteria. 

Your application will remain open either until you have been offered a place or until all the places have been filled, which is likely to be on or before September 1st.

## Application criteria

We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive. We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.

+ Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes;
+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);
+ Create some kata on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new);
+ Contribute to [our community on GitHub](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)
(in particular, our [READMEs](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs));
+ contribute to [our Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone)

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time, but please do not be daunted. 

We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, and use our Gitter channel.

Please be aware that meeting the minimum criteria is not alone sufficient to secure a place. Achieving high scores on Codewars and active participation on Gitter and GitHub are helpful to an application, but not necessarily decisive. 

Achieving a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort is also important to us.
