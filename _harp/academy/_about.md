Founders & Coders has created a new model for education.

We run a full-time, 16-week course in full-stack software development using JavaScript and Node.js. 46/47 of our recent graduates are working as software developers.

We aim to give students the best possible training in software development. In return we ask you to help us deliver subsequent courses and to contribute to our various community projects.

We also ask you to contribute in one of three ways:

- Join our freelance community - earning a living while learning and working on interesting projects with our senior developers.

- Let us to place you with one of our partners so that we can get a recruitment fee.

- Donate 10% of your salary for your first year of employment.

If you graduate and decide to start your own project we will encourage you to remain in the space and get support from our network.
