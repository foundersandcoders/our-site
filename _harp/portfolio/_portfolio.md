# PORTFOLIO
During the third phase of the programme, our students gain professional experience by leading workshops and building prototypes for clients such as charities, nonprofits, and early-stage startups. By the time graduates leave Founders & Coders for full-time employment, they have a diverse portfolio that impresses potential employers.
