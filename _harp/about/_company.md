Founders & Coders is a UK-based nonprofit organization that runs a tuition-free coding academy in London. We have trained more than 150 students on our full-time programme. Over the last two years, more than 90% of our graduates have gone on to work in software or a related field. We generate income by charging recruitment fees when employers hire our graduates. We also provide technical expertise and training to nonprofits, local businesses and early-stage startups.

In partnership with the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy Tel Aviv and the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, we opened our first international campus in Nazareth, the heart of Arab society in Israel, in February 2017. Founders & Coders Nazareth aims to facilitate engagement between Arab society and the Israeli hi-tech industry and to support the economic development of Nazareth and communities in the Galilee.
