Founders & Coders is a UK-based nonprofit organization that runs a tuition-free coding academy in London. We have trained more than 150 students on our full-time programme. Over the last two years, more than 90% of our graduates have gone on to work in software or a related field. We generate income by charging recruitment fees when employers hire our graduates. We also provide technical expertise and training to nonprofits, local businesses and early-stage startups.

In February 2017, we opened Founders & Coders Nazareth, our first international campus.
