Founders & Coders is a nonprofit social enterprise that runs a tuition-free coding bootcamp in London. We support ourselves by providing technical expertise and training to nonprofits and early-stage startups. With the support of the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy, we are opening our first international campus in Nazareth in early 2017.
