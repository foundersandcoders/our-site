# About us

Founders & Coders C.I.C. runs the only free full-time coding course in the UK. We have developed a highly effective peer-led model of learning which, after only two years of operation, attracts exceptional women and men from all over the world. 

After completing the course, students are encouraged to join our freelance community and to contribute to a growing array of community activities, including the course itself.

We support ourselves entirely through voluntary contributions from our alumni, through placement fees from employers, and through our close working relationship with [dwyl](http://www.dwyl.io/), which provides freelance experience to many of our graduates.

We believe this to be a replicable model of training that is capable of addressing acute skills shortages, widening access to work opportunities, and offering life-changing personal empowerment free at the point of delivery and without ongoing subsidies.

We are partnering with a number of organisations in the social enterprise and charity sectors to provide freelancing and employment opportunities for our graduates and to open new schools in the UK and abroad.

## Our hiring rate

We encourage our graduates to freelance with us after they graduate, so the usual measure of graduate success, the *"hiring rate"*,  a bit misleading, but of the 52 students who studied with us in 2014/15 and who actively sought development work, all 52 are working either freelance or in permanent roles. In effect, our success rate is 100%. 

To reiterate, not a single person who has studied with us since 2014 and who has actively sought development work has failed to find it.
