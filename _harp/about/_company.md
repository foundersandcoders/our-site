# About us

*Founders & Coders C.I.C.* runs what is probably the most challenging course in software development in the UK. We take students with little or no knowledge of programming and bring them up to a level where they are capable of finding employment, working freelance or starting their own project. We aim for 100% of our graduates to be earning a living in software development.

Our intention is to provide the best possible training in web development - for free. We manage this through the support of our mentors, the tech community and our graduates, who often join our faculty to help to teach future cohorts.
