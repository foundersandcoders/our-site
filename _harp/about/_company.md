Founders & Coders is a UK-based nonprofit organization that runs a tuition-free, peer-led coding academy in London. We give back to the community by providing technical expertise and training to nonprofits, local businesses, and early-stage startups. We generate income by charging recruitment fees when employers hire our graduates.

With the support of the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy Tel Aviv, we are opening our first international campus in Nazareth, the heart of Arab society in Israel, in February 2017. Founders & Coders will support both the economic development of Nazareth and facilitate engagement between Arab society and the Israeli hi-tech industry.
