## History

As a project manager working on the London 2012 Olympics websites, Dan realized how much he missed the challenges of software development, and when the project wrapped, he decided to take some online programming courses to refresh his skills. In 2013, he started organising regular meetups at the British Library with other people taking similar courses.

Dan realised he loved peer-led learning so when Camden Collective offered him some space, he decided to expand the meetups by setting up a classroom where aspiring developers could collaborate, and Founders & Coders’ first official cohort began in January 2014.

In December 2014, during the last week of the third cohort at the Camden Collective, Founders & Coders were informed that the space they were using would not be available for the next cohort. Spurred to action, the third cohort spent the last week of their course organising a successful Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for the rent.

In January 2015, Ines and Nelson joined the team as a Director and Lead Technical Mentor respectively, bringing with them years of industry experience, and the fourth course began at Founders & Coders’ new home in Bethnal Green. Most of the third cohort stayed to organise the fourth course, providing critical mentorship and together, deepening the community ethos that continues to define Founders & Coders.

Founders & Coders has become a highly selective programme with a reputation for producing outstanding graduates. In summer 2016, Dan met Rebecca Radding, an educator, in Israel and began planning for the international expansion of Founders & Coders, starting with Nazareth in February 2017.
