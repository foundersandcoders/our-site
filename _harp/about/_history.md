## History

Founders & Coders began in 2014 when Dan Sofer, who had worked for years as a software developer and project manager, decided to take some online programming courses to refresh his skills. He started meeting regularly with other people taking similar courses, and Founders & Coders was born. 

Dan realised he loved peer-led learning and decided to expand the meetups by setting up a classroom space where aspiring developers could collaborate. Eager students flocked to Danâ€™s courses. Eventually, Dan got so busy recruiting work for his students that the programme had to run itself&mdash;and it did. Former students provided critical mentorship and curricular guidance. Founders & Coders blossomed into a vibrant, self-organising community.

In January 2015, when FAC moved to Bethnal Green, Ines and Nelson joined the team, bringing with them years of industry experience and an extraordinary level of commitment to the continuing development of the programme.
