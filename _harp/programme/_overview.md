We have graduated more than 200 students on our full-time programmes in [London](./course-information/london). Over the last two years, more than 90% of our graduates have gone on to work in software or a related field.

We believe that high quality education should be accessible to everyone. Our students continue to be involved with our programme long after they graduate. With their support and the work of the broader Founders & Coders community, we continue to offer our programmes for free at the point of delivery.

Founders & Coders welcomes applicants over 18 from all academic and professional backgrounds. We find that successful students are self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

### Self-learning and meetups

Prospective students use online materials to teach themselves the fundamentals of programming and have the option to attend weekly in-person meetups at the Founders & Coders campus while they are preparing and submitting their applications to the course.

### Prep-course

After conducting interviews, we select a group of finalists for an in-person, weekly prep-course, where we provide support completing [our course prerequisites](../apply/prerequisites).

### 16-week full-time coding bootcamp

Our immersive course is peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns delivering workshops, running code reviews and managing projects. The course covers test-driven development, using a full JavaScript stack (JavaScript and Node.js) with relational databases. We also teach aspects of UX design and project management.

Our curriculum is an entirely open source project and is [available for viewing on GitHub](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/info/blob/master/curriculum.md).

### 10-week full-time mentorship + portfolio building + job interviews

During this period, every bootcamp graduate is expected to:
+ Spend up to twenty percent of their time mentoring the next cohort.
+ Complete portfolio projects with local businesses, startups, or non-profit organisations.
+ Begin applying for positions with our recruitment partners.

### Employment

Each place on the Founders & Coders programme costs us about Â£3,000 to provide. We ask you to consider either seeking employment with one of our partners who will help pay for these costs or, alternatively, making a regular voluntary contribution after you graduate. This is a way of 'paying it forward', so that we can provide a place for someone in a future cohort.
