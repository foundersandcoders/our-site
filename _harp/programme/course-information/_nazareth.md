### Location and Directions

Founders & Coders Nazareth is based at the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, inside the Khan El Basha Building, across from the Basilica of the Annunciation.

Nazareth is a small city of 75,000 people, with a mixed Christian and Muslim population.

### Hours

Our Nazareth programme runs Sunday through Thursday from 10 AM to 6 PM.

### Accommodation

Founders & Coders manages a guest house in Nazareth for our students and mentors, located across the street from our campus at Khan el-Basha. Rent for a private room is £400 a month, including city tax, utilities, and internet. Food prices are similar to those in the UK and Europe.

We will help local students find affordable housing in Nazareth, including flats for women only.

### Financial support

At this time, we do not offer financial support to local or international students. We are actively exploring ways to provide a modest living stipend to local students.

### Security

Please see the [official UK recommendations](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) for travel in Israel.
