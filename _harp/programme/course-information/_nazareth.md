<h2 align='center'>NAZARETH PROGRAMME</h2>

### Location and Directions

Founders & Coders Nazareth is based at the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, inside the Khan El Basha Building, across from the Basilica of the Annunciation.

Nazareth is a small city of 75,000 people, with a mixed Christian and Muslim population. It is considered the center of Arab society in Israel.

### Hours

Our Nazareth programme runs Sunday through Thursday from 10 AM to 6 PM.

### Dates

Our next programmes begin July 2, October 29 and February 24.

Each programme runs for 16 weeks. After graduation, you will be expected to help mentor the following cohort, and we will help you find employment.

### Eligibility

If you are over the age of 18 and can legally enter Israel, you are eligible to apply for our Nazareth programme.
We welcome international applicants who commit to spending 16 weeks in Israel. Please note that students coming from outside Israel will not receive any financial support during the programme.

### Accommodation

We will help local students find affordable housing in Nazareth, including flats for women only.
Founders & Coders manages a guest house in Nazareth for our international students and mentors, located across the street from our campus at Khan el-Basha. Rent for a private room is £400 a month, including city tax, utilities, and internet. Food prices are similar to those in the UK and Europe.

### Stipends

At this time, we do not offer financial support to local or international students. We are actively exploring ways to provide a modest living stipend to local students.

### Partners

Founders & Coders Nazareth is a partnership between Founders & Coders International, the UK Israel Tech Hub, the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, and Tsofen High Technology Centers.

### Security
