<h1 align='center'>APPLY TO FOUNDERS & CODERS</h1>

Applications are open for our next set of courses, which begin in late October.

Get started by creating a new account on each of the following websites (you will need these accounts in order to submit an application):

1. [GitHub](www.github.com/)
2. [Free Code Camp](www.freecodecamp.com/) (sign up using your new GitHub account)
3. [Codewars](www.codewars.com/) (use your GitHub account again)

Before beginning a Founders & Coders programme, you will need to complete [our prerequisites](./prerequisites). Please apply _as soon as you decide you are interested_ - **we do not expect you finish the course prerequisites before putting in your application**. But you should make a sincere effort to start this work before we conduct interviews.

Choose a location to learn more about the application and selection process at each of our campuses.
