<h1 align='center'>APPLY</h1>

  Our programmes in Nazareth and London run three times a year, starting in February, June and October.

  Applications for our Summer 2017 programmes open in March.

<h2 align='center'> HOW DO I APPLY FOR THE PROGRAMME?<h2>

### STEP 1

  Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.

### STEP 2

  Complete the [Expression of Interest](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/interest.html) form.


  When we receive your Expression of Interest, we will invite you to our Coding for Everyone community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). Please, join us and introduce yourself.

  If you do not receive an invitation within 3 days, please re-submit your Expression of Interest, checking that you have entered your GitHub username accurately.

### STEP 3

  Join [Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/).

### STEP 4

  Join [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

  Note: When joining Codewars, you will be asked to solve a basic coding exercise. If you cannot solve it, please skip this step and return to it when you have spent a few hours practicing [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript) on Free Code Camp.

  Note: You can easily use your GitHub account to join [Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

### STEP 5*

  [Create an empty repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) on GitHub, where you will eventually build your own one-page website.

### STEP 6

  A) Prepare an application video that answers these questions (if you do not want to video yourself, please do a screencast instead):

  1. Why do you want to do join the programme?
  2. How would you like to use technology to help others?
  3. What do you intend to do when you finish?
  4. What really motivates you?
  5. If we could open a Founders & Coders anywhere else in the world, where would you want it to be?

### Please:
  * Make sure you keep it to under two minutes.
  * Use YouTube or Vimeo or a similar service.
  * Record your voice at an adequate sound level.


  B) [Complete the application form](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/now).

  <h3>Your application will be considered only after the closing date for applications, so you can continue to work on Codewars and Freecodecamp (See COURSE PREREQUISITES below) until that date.</h3>

  You can expect to hear from us within 14 days of the application closing date.

<h2 align='center'>COURSE PREREQUISITES<h2>
<h3> If you want to be accepted, you want to at least make sure you complete these three steps before the application closing date.</h3>
### 1)

  If you have not done any programming before, then you will probably need to allow yourself a minimum of 100 hours on Front End Development on http://www.freecodecamp.com/ before you are ready to tackle Codewars.

  Please skip over Bootstrap and jQuery sections, as they are not required.

### 2)

  A) Aim to get to at least 5 kyu on https://www.codewars.com/ by the time the application window closes. We find that this process typically requires a minimum of 100 hours of study.

  B) Create at least one kata: https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript.

### 3)

  Referring to step 5* from the instructions to apply for the programme, edit the repo you created to end up with one-page website using GitHub pages. https://pages.github.com/

  Note: We recommend not using frameworks like Bootstrap & jQuery. Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
