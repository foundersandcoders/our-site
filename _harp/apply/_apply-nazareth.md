Apply today for our next course, which runs from October 29, 2017 through to February 15, 2018. Our Nazareth campus is an international programme taught in English. For the course beginning in October, we plan to offer 8-12 spots to local people (from Israel) and 4-8 spots to people from outside Israel (including the West Bank).

<h2 align='center'>CANDIDATES APPLYING FROM ISRAEL</h2>

We will interview all interested local candidates in late July. We will then select 12-16 people for an eight week prep-course, where we will provide structured support for completing the course prerequisites. All those who successfully complete our course prerequisites before the end of September are guaranteed a place on the October course.

We will interview all interested international candidates via Skype before August 31.
