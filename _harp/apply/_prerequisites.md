3. When you’re ready (which could be after some work on Free Code Camp), create a one-page website using GitHub pages. Your website can be about anything you like, so pick a topic you think is interesting! Note: We recommend not using frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery. Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
