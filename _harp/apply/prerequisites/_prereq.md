1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (note: you can easily use this account to join Gitter, freeCodeCamp, and Codewars)

2. Join our online community on Gitter, and actively participate in the chatroom:
   + [London](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/london)

3. To help you while you’re working on the prerequisites, we host regular meetups. Please make every effort to attend. You can find out more about our meetups by submitting an [expression of interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepdNxKsrMjhfnbdkzKUgNpeWFmp8WLyiqTe_UY10TsPpFOEQ/viewform) or in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/london).

4. We love [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and think it’s a fantastic way to begin your journey as a web developer. Complete the following sections on freeCodeCamp's updated curriculum:
   + Responsive Web Design Certification:
     + Basic HTML and HTML5
     + Basic CSS
     + Responsive Web Design Principles
     + CSS Flexbox
   + Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification:
     + Basic JavaScript
     + ES6
     + Basic Data Structures
     + Basic Algorithm Scripting

    _Completing these recommended sections should leave you with at least 200 points, but you are encouraged to also complete any of the other topics that take your interest._

5. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) provides a strong introduction to the problem-solving skills you’ll need in order to be successful as a web developer. You will need to:
   + Reach 5 kyu and 300 honor points in JavaScript on Codewars
   + [Create at least one JavaScript kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript)
      + Before creating your kata, check out these tips from Codewars on [creating your first kata](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Create-Your-First-Kata) and [kata best practices](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Best-Practices).

6. When you’re ready (which could be after some work on freeCodeCamp), create a one-page website using GitHub Pages. Your website must:
   + Tell us something interesting about yourself that will support your application;
   + Contain a link back to the GitHub repo which contains the code for your site;
   + Contain links to your freeCodeCamp and Codewars pages;
   + Not use a GitHub theme;
   + Not use a framework like Bootstrap or libraries like jQuery.

  Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
