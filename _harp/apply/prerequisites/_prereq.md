1. To help you while you’re working on the prerequisites, we host [regular meetups](https://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/events/). Please make every effort to attend.

2. Create a GitHub account (note: you can easily use this account to join Free Code Camp and Codewars, our other prerequisites)

3. Join our online community on Gitter, and actively participate in the chatroom of the course for which you are applying:
   + [London](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/london)
   + [Nazareth](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/nazareth)

4. We love [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and think it’s a fantastic way to begin your journey as a web developer. Complete the following sections on Free Code Camp's Front End Development course:
   + HTML5 & CSS
   + Basic JavaScript
   + Object Oriented and Functional Programming
   + Basic Algorithm Scripting

5. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) provides a strong introduction to the problem-solving skills you’ll need in order to be successful as a web developer. You will need to:
   + Reach 5 kyu in JavaScript on Codewars
   + [Create at least one JavaScript kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript)

6. When you’re ready (which could be after some work on Free Code Camp), create a one-page website using GitHub Pages. Your website must:
   + Tell us something interesting about yourself that will support your application;
   + Contain a link back to the GitHub repo which contains the code for your site;
   + Contain links to your Free Code Camp and Codewars pages;
   + Not use a GitHub theme;
   + Not use a framework like Bootstrap or libraries like jQuery.

  Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
