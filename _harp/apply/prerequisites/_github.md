1. Create a GitHub account (note: you can easily use this account to join Free Code Camp and Codewars, our other prerequisites)
2. Join our online community on Gitter, and actively participate in the chatroom of the course for which you are applying:
   + [London](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/london)
   + [Nazareth](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/nazareth)
3. When youâ€™re ready (which could be after some work on Free Code Camp), create a one-page website using GitHub Pages. Your website must:
   + Tell us something interesting about yourself that will support your application;
   + Contain a link back to the GitHub repo which contains the code for your site;
   + Contain links to your Free Code Camp and Codewars pages;
   + Not use a GitHub theme;
   + Not use a framework like Bootstrap or libraries like jQuery.

Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
