1. Create a GitHub account (note: you can easily use this account to join Free Code Camp and Codewars, our other prerequisites)
2. Join our online community on Gitter, and actively participate in the chatroom of the course for which you are applying:
  + [London](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/london)
  + [Nazareth](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/nazareth)
3. When youâ€™re ready (which could be after some work on Free Code Camp), create a one-page website using GitHub pages. Your website can be about anything you like, so pick a topic you think is interesting! Note: We recommend not using frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery. Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.
