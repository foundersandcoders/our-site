<h2 align='center'>SELECTION PROCESS</h2>

Nazareth is an international programme taught in English. For the course beginning October 29, we plan to offer 16 places to a mix of local and international students (please note that we welcome applicants from the West Bank).

We plan to conduct two rounds of interviews for the October course, the first has already been conducted in late July and the second one will be in late August.

<h2 align='center'>CANDIDATES APPLYING FROM ISRAEL</h2>

The first set of interviews have been conducted in July 20 for local candidates in Nazareth, and the international candidates who have completed the course prerequisites have been interviewed over Hangouts on July 26 and 27.

We will then select up to 12 local candidates for an eight-week prep-course, where we will provide structured support for completing the [course prerequisites](./prerequisites). All those who attend all sessions of the prep-course _and_ successfully complete our course prerequisites before the end of September are guaranteed a place on the October course.

Candidates who submit applications between July 20 and August 20 may be invited to interview for any remaining places on the October programme during the last week in August.

Candidates who complete the course prerequisites between July 20 and August 20 may be invited to interview for any remaining places on the October programme during last week in August.
