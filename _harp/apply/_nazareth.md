<h2 align='center'>SELECTION PROCESS</h2>

Nazareth is an international programme taught in English. For the course beginning in October, we plan to offer 16 places to a mix of local and international students (please note that we welcome applicants from the West Bank).

<h2 align='center'>CANDIDATES APPLYING FROM ISRAEL</h2>

We will interview all interested local candidates in late July. We will then select 12-16 people for an eight-week prep-course, where we will provide structured support for completing the [course prerequisites](./prerequisites). All those who successfully complete our course prerequisites before the end of September are guaranteed a place on the October course.

<h2 align='center'>CANDIDATES APPLYING FROM OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL</h2>

We will interview all interested international candidates via Skype before August 31.

<h2 align='center'>HOW TO PREPARE</h2>
