Apply today for our next course, which runs from 23 October, 2017 until February 9, 2018.

We will review applications and offer interviews at the end of July to all candidates who have completed the course prerequisites. Interviews will be conducted in-person (or via Google hangouts) in early August. We will select 16 people for the course and will not be offering a prep-course for our October programme.

All applications received from August onwards will enter the pool for our February course, which begins 18 February, 2018. We will be conducting interviews for the February course in October and will be offering a prep-course to support candidates for this programme.
