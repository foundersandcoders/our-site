# UX Design

If you have an idea for a web application, we can design the user experience. Including:

+ ***Personas*** to represent the intended application users.
+ ***User journeys*** to represent all the step-by-step user interactions.
+ ***Wireframes*** to represent the entire application layout.
+ ***User stories***, describing every user interaction with the application.
+ ***A design prototype***, which provides a complete look-and-feel for the application.

After completing the UX design, the *user stories* and the *design prototype* can be used for building a [working prototype](prototyping.html).
