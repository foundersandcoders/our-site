# Our value proposition

In the Autumn of 2012, I signed up for Andrew Ng's online [machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) course. I loved the idea of having access to a world of learning online, but I failed to complete the course. The turning point came with the next online course that I tried in early 2013. This time, I organised a meetup for it at the café in the British Library. 

Four of us completed that course together and then, over the year, I ended up organising dozens of meetups for several other online courses. The experience was transformative and not because of the online materials, but because of the meetups. The courses just created a context for what really mattered: sharing the experience of studying something  interesting together.

Towards the end of the year, I was offered a space in the [Collective project](http://camdencollective.co.uk/) in Camden Town. This gave me the chance to experiment with the idea of free, peer-led learning with a full-time web development course based around online material. The first course begun in January 2014. 

The curriculum evolved rapidly. We stopped using structured online material and started developing an open-ended, group-led, project-based approach. At one point the shift in course content was so radical that one student asked to take the course again. He became an unofficial teaching assistant. 

Then, unexpectedly, three students were offered the chance to work together on a project that should have been far too ambitious for them. It wasn't. And their example inspired the next cohort of students. By the time of the fourth, and what proved to be the last, course in Camden Town, the ambition of the students had escalated to the point where most of them, after only eight weeks of learning, aspired to be software developers.

Work opportunities began to trickle in. Camden Council offered some of our graduates a mapping project; a couple of startups asked for our help. This had never been about building a business and our first customers felt more like collaborators than clients, but slowly we were bootstrapping ourselves.

When the funding and support in Camden Town ran out, almost the entire body of 16 students rose to the challenge. We found a new space in Tower Hamlets, crowdfunded £10,000 on Indiegogo, and moved. People began to peel off and find work, but most of us stayed to welcome our first cohort into the new space at the beginning of 2015. 

We now had not just students, but several mentors. Delivering the curriculum and supporting the students became a collective effort. New ideas emerged weekly. The pace of curriculum development picked up and the quality of the learning experience continued to improve. The mentors seemed to be learning as much as the students.

By now, we had turned ourselves into a social enterprise and were operating as a freelance co-operative. Work was coming in, barely enough to support ourselves, but we were too busy with the pedagogy to take business development seriously.

Now, as our second cohort of students prepares to graduate from our new home on the Roman Road, as we take on increasingly ambitious projects, as we have ever greater confidence in our own skills, we are beginning to look beyond our own space and are seeking ways to collaborate with others.

Since the beginning, *Founders & Coders* has been primarily about the empowerment that we have all experienced from being in a deeply collaborative learning environment working on interesting problems. We thrive as an organisation only because that sense of empowerment is shared by us all.

From that motivation comes our value proposition:

    We empower people and organisations
    Through wholehearted and open collaboration
    To solve interesting problems with software.
