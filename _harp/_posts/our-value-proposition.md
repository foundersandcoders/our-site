# Our value proposition

In his great talk on [How great leaders inspire action](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) Simon Sinek introduces the idea of the *golden circle* of *Why*, *How* and *What*. 

HubSpot [nicely summarises the key message](http://blog.hubspot.com/customers/3-takeaways-from-start-with-why) as:

    "People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."

To understand our *Why?*, we have to start in the Autumn of 2012 when I signed up for Andrew Ng's online [machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) course. I loved the idea of having access to a world of learning online, but I failed to complete the course. The turning point came with the next online course that I tried in early 2013. This time, I organised a meetup for it at the cafe in the British Library. 

We completed that course and then, over the course of a year, many of us ended up attending dozens of meetups for several other online courses. The experience was transformative for us and not because of the online materials, but because of the meetups. The courses just created a context for what really mattered: sharing the experience of studying something together that we all found interesting.

So, since the beginning, *Founders & Coders* has been primarily about the empowerment that we have all experienced from being in a deeply collaborative environment working on interesting problems. We thrive as an organisation only because that sense of empowerment is shared by us all.

From that motivation comes our value proposition:

    We empower people and organisations
    Through deep and open collaboration
    To solve interesting problems with software.
